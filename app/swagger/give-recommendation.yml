summary: Provide recommendations based on the highest carbon footprint sectors
description: >
        This function is invoked through a POST request to analyze a user's carbon footprint across different sectors, including business travel, energy usage, and waste management. By comparing the carbon footprints from these sectors, the function identifies the sector(s) with the highest carbon footprint for the specified user. It then provides tailored recommendations to help the user reduce their carbon footprint in those areas. The recommendations are fetched from predefined text files associated with each sector. *** All sectors must be filled before ***
parameters:
