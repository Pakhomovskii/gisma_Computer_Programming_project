summary: Provide recommendations based on the highest carbon footprint sectors
description: >
        This function is invoked through a GET request to analyze a user's carbon footprint across different sectors, including business travel, energy usage, and waste management. By comparing the carbon footprints from these sectors, the function identifies the sector(s) with the highest carbon footprint for the specified user. It then provides tailored recommendations to help the user reduce their carbon footprint in those areas. The recommendations are fetched from predefined text files associated with each sector. *** All sectors must be filled ***
parameters:
- in: query
  name: user_uuid
  description: >
     The `user_uuid` is the unique identifier for the user whose carbon footprint is being analyzed. This UUID must be included in the query parameters of the GET request.
  required: true
  schema:
    type: string
